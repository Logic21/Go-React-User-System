# Go-React-User-System

A single-page user-system made with ReactJS, Redux & Golang!!

# Usage
1. Open PHPMyAdmin, create a db & import `db.sql`.
2. Go to `models/db.go` & change DB connection settings.
3. My root folder name is `Go-React-User-System`, if yours is different then go ahead & change it as it used for imports. It can be done easily by searching the whole project.
4. Enjoy!!
